# snow_ice_rs_albedo
Scripts to generate snow and ice albedo from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance and MODIS BRDF information. The inputs are Sentinel-2 surface reflectance images; MODIS MOD09GA surface
reflectance product; and observed incoming/outgoing shortwave radiation, air temperature, and relative humidity. The meteorological information can also be estimated by the user
from another sources if a station is not available.
